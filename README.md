# Project_Pokemon

 In this repo you will find two csv files that are used at different points in the code.
 
 The pdf "Pokemon Project.pptx" is the pdf download of our presentation. Sadly this loses the few animations, but this ensures that all graphs and titles remain 
 
 The "Project_Pokemon.ipynb" is our code where we are analyse the data and create various graphs and plots to explore the wonderful world of Pokemon
